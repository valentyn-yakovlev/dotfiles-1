* OSX Gotchas

  Use virtual machine to get actual work done.  There's some stuff you can do to
  make life more comfortable on the host though:

  Install homebrew and install these:

  - virtualbox
  - chromium-freesmug

** 1password

   1password doesn't like Chromium.  Install the OSX app and go to preferences →
   advanced → uncheck verify browser code signature.

* JS
** yarn
   =yarn= is the only package that should be installed globally with =npm=.

   This might change in the future because it
   [[https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/commit/b217c0a99ba22371b2a73821a8e127892f2e24d4][just
   landed]] in =nixpkgs=.

   At that time the symlinks =${HOME}/.local/bin/{yarn,yarnpkg}= should be
   removed.  The same goes for other global packages that could be managed by
   =nix=.

** =eslint-cli=

   Use this instead of global installation of =eslint=.  It will find a
   project's local version of =eslint= and run that.

   #+begin_example
   $ yarn global add eslint-cli
   #+end_example

** =tern=

   Don't forget to add =.tern-port= to your =.gitignore=.

   #+begin_example
   $ yarn global add tern
   #+end_example

** =nvm=
   I used to use =nvm= at work to manage the transient global =node= version.
   It turns out that
   [[http://anderspapitto.com/posts/2016-10-04-transient-global-environments-the-third-path.html][Nix
   does this much better]].

   So just use =nix-env --query= to see what versions of =node= are available in
   the current profile, =nix-env --query --available nodejs= to see what
   versions are available and so on.

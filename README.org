* JS
** =eslint-cli=

   Use this instead of global installation of =eslint=.  It will find a
   project's local version of =eslint= and run that.

** =tern=

   Don't forget to add =.tern-port= to your =.gitignore=.

** =nvm=

   I used to use =nvm= at work to manage the transient global =node= version.
   It turns out that
   [[http://anderspapitto.com/posts/2016-10-04-transient-global-environments-the-third-path.html][Nix
   does this much better]].

   So just use =nix-env --query= to see what versions of =node= are available in
   the current profile, =nix-env --query --available nodejs= to see what
   versions are available and so on.

* GNOME 3

  Gnome uses its own registry thing (~dconf~) for a bunch of configuration and
  stateful data, so there's a hook in this repo that saves the output of ~dconf
  dump~ when commiting.

  On a new machine you probably have to import it, see the script
  ~bin/dconf-restore~.

* NixOS

** =nix-env=

   By default, =nix-env= ignores =$NIX_PATH=.  So if you want to use a local
   checkout of =nixpkgs= instead of the configured channel, you have to tell it
   to use =nixpkgs= like so:

   #+begin_example
   nix-env -f '<nixpkgs>' -i rkm
   #+end_example

* OSX Gotchas

  Use virtual machine to get actual work done.  There's some stuff you can do to
  make life more comfortable on the host though:

  Install homebrew and:

  #+begin_example
  brew cask install virtualbox chromium 1password
  #+end_example

** Virtualbox

  For the guest, enable a second host-only adapter under "Networks".  This will
  provide the interface for using SSH locally.  Leave the first NAT interface
  the way it it already configured because that provides the actual connection
  to the internet.

** 1password

   1password doesn't like Chromium.  Install the OSX app and go to preferences →
   advanced → uncheck verify browser code signature.

** =Terminal.app=                                                    :ATTACH:

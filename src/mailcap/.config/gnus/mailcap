# This file tells those programs that support it (mutt et alii) what other
# programs to use to view files with certain MIME types.  A description of what
# this file may contain can be found in RFC 1524 or, for a more
# beginner-friendly overview, section 5.3 or thereabouts of the mutt manual.

# MIME types that appear twice have two different entries: one for viewing the
# file in a separate application and one (marked with "copiousoutput") for
# transforming the file into text that can be viewed from within the original
# program.

# this example from http://sdf.org/tutorials/dotfiles/.mailcap_jwodder

# text/html; lynx -force_html %s; nametemplate=%s.html
# text/html; lynx -force_html -dump %s; copiousoutput; nametemplate=%s.html
# text/richtext; richtext %s | $PAGER -fr; needsterminal
# There's a reason why I bothered to include this next line, but I forgot it.
# text/*; $PAGER

# application/html; lynx -dump %s; copiousoutput; nametemplate=%s.html
# application/postscript; ps2ascii %s; copiousoutput

[pair rkm_contacts]

# synchronized. The definition of these storages follows in `[storage <name>]`
# blocks. This is similar to accounts in OfflineIMAP.

# You need to run `vdirsyncer discover` if new calendars/addressbooks are added
# on the server.

# Omitting this parameter implies that the given path and URL in the
# corresponding `[storage <name>]` blocks are already directly pointing to a
# collection each.
